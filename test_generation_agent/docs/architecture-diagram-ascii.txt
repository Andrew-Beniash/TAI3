Flow:
1. Azure DevOps service hook triggers on user story creation/update
2. Webhook service receives the payload
3. Embedding service vectorizes the user story
4. Similar stories and test cases are retrieved from vector DB
5. LangGraph agent uses context to generate test cases
6. Test cases are stored in vector DB and created in Azure DevOps
